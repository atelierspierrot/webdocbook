Markdown syntax
===============

The Markdown syntax used by *WebDocBook* follows the [Markdown Extended](http://github.com/piwi/markdown-extended)
rules. They are inherited from:

-   the original [John Gruber's syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
-   the ["extra" version from Michel Fortin](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/concepts/),
-   some features are also included from the [Fletcher Penny's MultiMarkdown](http://fletcher.github.com/peg-multimarkdown/).
