Vendor assets used by WebDocBook
================================

This directory stores all the third-parties *assets* packages that
are used by *WebDocBook*. You will find here some links to these packages
and their actual version numbers.

To rebuild them, you can use the `bower.json` configuration file of
this directory and make a  `bower install`. Then you will need to 
manually move each new versions files to replace existing one in
each subdirectories.

Special note for *Bootstrap* : as WebDocBook does not use the *Glyphicons*
any more, the package MUST be downloaded manually using the configuration
described below.

@TODO - the best would be to find "portable" replacements for the jQuery
plugins `jquery.highlights` and `jquery.juizScrollTo`.


Basic rules for dependencies assets
-----------------------------------

We have to keep in mind that any dependency MUST be light-weight in
*WebDocBook* (we usually only need some few files from each dependency).

-   try to use only minified versions of JS and CSS
-   only include one "package" file (bower.json, package.json ...)
-   always include any "license" file
