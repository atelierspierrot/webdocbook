Installing of *WebDocBook*
=======================

**WebDocBook** is quite simple to install as long as you can use Apache's `.htaccess` files.


Requirements
------------

To allow DocBook to work on your web-server, you need the following environment:

-   a web-server running a Linux/UNIX operating system,
-   your requests must be handled by [Apache 2](http://httpd.apache.org/)
    (or, at least, `.htaccess` files must be activated)
-   [PHP 5.3.0](http://php.net/) or higher.

If you had not downloaded an "**out-of-the-box**" version of DocBook, you will need to manually
build your installation. To do so, you need to install [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/)
on your system.

As the package uses some internal Apache's features, you will need to:

-   create a new directory in your web-server HTTP accessible part,
-   set up the rights of the apache-user of your system upon directories,
-   define a new virtual-host in your system using the sample configuration below,
-   define an `.htaccess` file in your directory root using the sample file below,
-   enables the [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/mod_rewrite.html) 
    Apache module (*see the [FAQ](#faq) section below for an "how-to"*)


Installation step-by-step
-------------------------

### Get a copy of the sources

You have four ways to get a copy of the sources:

-   create a project via Composer:

        ~$ php path/to/composer.phar create-project wdbo/webdocbook your/path/to/docbook dev-master --no-dev

    you can select a specific version replacing `dev-master` by the version number 

-   make a clone of the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/wdbo/webdocbook):

        ~$ git clone git://github.com/wdbo/webdocbook.git your/path/to/docbook

-   get an archive from GitHub, *untar* it in your target directory

-   download a tag version of the sources, see <http://github.com/wdbo/webdocbook/tags>.

For each stable version of DocBook, a new tag may exist named **vX.Y.Z**, if you prefer to
use a download version rather than a Git clone, use a tag preferably.

When available, any tag named like **vX.Y.Z-outofthebox** is a full and already installed 
copy of the concerned version. Note that this kind of package may not work on every systems
but it is the best practice to use them as they are already full and ready-to-use.


### Setting up the virtual host

See the [Virtual Host](DocBook-Virtual-Host.md) page for an "how-to".


### Test your new DocBook in a browser

Load the domain name you defined in your virtual host in a browser and check if the 
application works.

If you have an error like:

>    You need to run Composer on the project to build dependencies and auto-loading
>    (see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#using-composer)!

it means that your DocBook is not yet installed (*some required dependencies are missing*).
To finish the installation, just run:

    ~$ php path/to/composer.phar install

or, if you installed Composer globally in your environment:

    ~$ php composer install

Once the installation has finished, reload the page in your browser.

At the beginning, your DocBook contains three symbolic links to the Markdown files of the
package for demonstration. You can delete them as you like and begin to write and organize
your own contents.
