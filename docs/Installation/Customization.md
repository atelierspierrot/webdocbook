Customizing *WebDocBook*
=====================


Fallback system
---------------

The application is constructed to allow user to over-write the templates used to build the pages.
This feature is quite simple:

-   by default, the templates are embedded with the application in the `src/templates/` directory ;
-   any file found in the `user/templates/` will be taken primary to the default template.


Build custom templates
----------------------

As this application uses [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) to build its views, if you
want to write your own templates you may follow [Twig's documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/documentation).
